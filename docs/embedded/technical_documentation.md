## Wiring Diagram

To recreate my embedded device, you can use the following wiring diagram as a reference. The wiring diagram visually
represents how the different components are connected in the circuit. On the left there is a table that describes the
function of each wire color. The wires are color coded to make it easier to follow the diagram.

On the right side of the diagram, there is a visual representation of the circuit. The diagram was created
using [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/). The diagram is also available as
a [Fritzing file](../assets/embedded/technical_documentation/fritzing.fzz).
