# Learning Journal

> Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your
> learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of your
> questions,
> and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

> So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it in
> your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it in
> your project.

| Monday    | I followed the introduction today. Already read the study manual so there was not a lot of new information. I chose the Calendar blueprint.                                                                                                                       |
| Wednesday | Today I retrieved my IoT kit and soldered the headers onto the WEMOS. I also ran the Blink program on it and it worked.                                                                                                                                           |
| Thursday  | The day started with the course of Wilko. I had trouble paying attention to it. In the afternoon after a short introduction of Mats, I started working on the web application. I managed to set up a connection to my database.                                   |
| Friday    | Worked on the planning for the next couple of weeks. I have planned it so that the my planning for the day is based on the expertise of the available teachers of that day. So for Mondays I work on physical design, on Wednesdays on embedded devices and so on. |
