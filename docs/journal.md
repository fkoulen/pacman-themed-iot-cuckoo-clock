# Learning Journal

> Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your
> learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of your
> questions,
> and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

> So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it in
> your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it in
> your project.

# Week 2

### Sunday (17th of September)
Today I continued working on the REST API. I implemented the Create & Read endpoint. So far I've learned more about 
classes and objects in PHP by using PHP Data Objects (PDO). I have also used these endpoints in my web application.

### Saturday (16th of September)
Today I learned how to structure my code in a better way. I started with creating the REST API for my web application.
I used [this tutorial](https://www.codeofaninja.com/create-simple-rest-api-in-php/) to help me with this. 

### Thursday (14th of September)

Today I implemented CRUD functionality in my web application. I did this with the help of [this
course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-crud-application-php-mysql/learn/lecture/7000068#reviews).

Found this useful graphic of the Wemos D1 Mini pinout:

I also connected the WEMOS to Wi-Fi and retrieved the amount of chocolate cups from the koffiepunt API. Afterward I 
started looking into creating my own API.


### Wednesday (13th of September)

### Tuesday (12th of September)

Today I messed around with the Arduino and watched some courses of Paul McWhorter on YouTube. I've so far learned the
following:

* [Arduino Tutorial 1: Setting Up and Programming the Arduino for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJWR7dBuc18&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP&index=1&pp=iAQB)

  not finished yet)

### Monday (11th of September)

Today I listened to the explanation of Joey about 3D printing & laser cutting. I have also 3d printed a guitar pick and
a bookmark myself.
Next to that, I also had my first performance review with Marise and I have worked on the design phase of physical
design. I worked out the user, needs, goals & requirements in bullet points.

# Week 1

| Day       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Friday    | Worked on the planning for the next couple of weeks. I have planned it so that the my planning for the day is based on the expertise of the available teachers of that day. So for Mondays I work on physical design, on Wednesdays on embedded devices and so on. |
| Thursday  | The day started with the course of Wilko. I had trouble paying attention to it. In the afternoon after a short introduction of Mats, I started working on the web application. I managed to set up a connection to my database.                                    |
| Wednesday | Today I retrieved my IoT kit and soldered the headers onto the WEMOS. I also ran the Blink program on it and it worked.                                                                                                                                            |
| Monday    | I followed the introduction today. Already read the study manual so there was not a lot of new information. I chose the Calendar blueprint.                                                                                                                        |
