# Learning Journal

> Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your
> learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of your
> questions,
> and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it in
your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it in
your project.

| Monday    | I followed the introduction today. Already read the study manual so there was not a lot of new information. I chose the Calendar blueprint.                                                                                                                        |
| Wednesday | Today I retrieved my IoT kit and soldered the headers onto the WEMOS. I also ran the Blink program on it and it worked.                                                                                                                                            |
| Thursday  | The day started with the course of Wilko. I had trouble paying attention to it. In the afternoon after a short introduction of Mats, I started working on the web application. I managed to set up a connection to my database.                                    |
| Friday    | Worked on the planning for the next couple of weeks. I have planned it so that the my planning for the day is based on the expertise of the available teachers of that day. So for Mondays I work on physical design, on Wednesdays on embedded devices and so on. |

| Monday | Today I listened to the explanation of Joey about 3D printing & laser cutting. I have also 3d printed a guitar pick and a bookmark myself. Next to that, I also had my first performance review with Marise and I have worked on the design phase of physical design. I worked out the user, needs, goals & requirements in bullet points. |
